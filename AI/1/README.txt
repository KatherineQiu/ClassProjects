First project of CSC442 Artificial Intelligence

Environment: 
1) Mac OS X High Serria 10.13.6
2) python3 interpreter(versiton 3.6.6)

Documents:
1) basicTTT.py: basic version of TTT
2) advancedTTT.py: advanced version of TTT
3) superTTT.py: super version of TTT
4) functions.py: help functions to do some outputs

Steps for basicTTT:
1) open terminal under the 'AI' folder
2) run the file with command line 'python basicTTT.py', make sure your python interpreter in your terminal is version 3
3) the first line you would see is 'Would u like first(x) or second(o):', you can play first if you input 'X' or 'x' while you can go second if you choose 'O' or 'o'. Other illegal inputs will be returned back to input again.
4) game starts. you and AI play in turn. Every turn you need to input one number(1-9) until the result is shown. 
5) Each turn will result in a display of board on terminal. In each turn of AI, the score of each possible move of AI and time it used are printed
6) after that, a new game will start automatically
7) use Ctrl/Command+C to exit game

Steps for advancedTTT:
1) open terminal under the 'AI' folder
2) run the file with command line 'python advancedTTT.py', make sure your python interpreter in your terminal is version 3
3) the first line you would see is 'Would u like first(x) or second(o):', you can play first if you input 'X' or 'x' while you can go second if you choose 'O' or 'o'. Other illegal inputs will be returned back to input again.
4) game starts. you need to input the number of board and the number of position or just the number of position according to the prompt. And AI makes input again.
5) each turn will result in a display of board on terminal. In each turn of AI, the score of each possible move of AI and time it used are printed
5) after that, a new game will start automatically
6) use Ctrl/Command+C to exit game 

Steps for superTTT:
the procedure is the same as advancedTTT except that you need to run the command line 'python superTTT.py' to start a game
